During the summer of 2023 through the Viterbi summer institute, I worked under Dr. Heather Culbertson on research within the USC HaRVI and Locomotor Control Labs; where my overall task is to utilize position data from participant trials in real time while using a robotic walker that reports inconsistencies in how much weight is being applied to it in correlation to a set target weight. This can be done by putting the said position data against a patients time in motion to get velocity; and with that velocity, we can see how much a participants movement may change to adhere to the walkers target weight. 

From here, the goal was to see how patients react to the walkers feedback, in which we anticipated that they would slow down in speed to adhere to the walkers target weight. And post-testing, we concluded that a participants speed (on average) does in fact decrease when having to apply more weight to the walker, and proceeded by by analyzing set target weights across different participants; in which our goal is to see trends in target weight vs velocity overall.
